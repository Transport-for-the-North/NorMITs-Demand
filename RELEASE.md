# Release Notes

The NorMITs Demand codebase follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); the convention
for most software products. In Summary this means the version numbers should be read in the
following way.

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g. 1.0.0), increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Note that the master branch of this repository contains a work in progress, and  may **not**
contain a stable version of the codebase. We aim to keep the master branch stable, but for the
most stable versions, please see the
[releases](https://github.com/Transport-for-the-North/NorMITs-Demand/releases)
page on GitHub. A log of all patches made between versions can also be found
there.
